    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series forecasting is a critical task in a variety of domains, ranging from finance to power\n",
    "management. While traditional statistical methods have been used, recent developments in\n",
    "machine learning and feature engineering have led to a significant improvement in forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to build an end-to-end time series forecasting pipeline,\n",
    "illustrating how careful feature engineering can greatly improve the predictive capability over a\n",
    "range of modeling approaches.\n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that we have chosen to use in this project is the [Historical Weather Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities) dataset from Kaggle.\n",
    "This dataset contains daily temperature data for major cities around the world, including the date and the average temperature for each day."
